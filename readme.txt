Robust tools for managing hierarchical page content in WordPress. Ideal for blogs with large page counts.

== Description ==

BU Navigation provides key tools you need to manage large numbers of pages.

* Replaces the built-in “Page Parent” and “Menu Order” dropdowns with an intuitive drag and drop interface for managing your page hierarchy
* The “Edit Order” screen presents you with a holistic view of your site’s structure for bulk ordering operations
* The Content Navigation widget presents a customizable sidebar navigation list fed from your natural page hierarchy
* Add external links to navigation lists with the “Add a Link” tool

Additionally, themes that support the primary navigation feature gain the ability to display a primary navigation list fed from page order. With two lines of code any theme can benefit from this feature-rich custom menu alternative.

* Display a primary navigation menu using the natural page hierarchy, eliminating the need for end-users to manage navigation lists separately from page order
* Navigation labels give you the ability to vary your page’s navigation label from their title
* Easily toggle the visibility of specific pages or sections of pages from your navigation menus
* Customize primary navigation settings through the “Primary Navigation” screen

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don’t see the “Primary Navigation” menu! How do I enable it? =
The “Primary Navigation” menu item will only appear if the current theme supports it.

Please see this page for more information:
[Adding Theme Support for Primary Navigation Menus](https://github.com/bu-ist/bu-navigation/wiki/Adding-Theme-Support-for-Primary-Navigation-Menus "BU Navigation Wiki on Github")

= How do I hide a page from my navigation lists? =

While editing your page, uncheck the “Display in navigation lists” checkbox next to the “Visibility” label inside the “Placement in Navigation” metabox. If the metabox is not visible, expand the “Screen Options” panel at the upper right hand corner of the screen and make sure the “Placement in Navigation” checkbox is checked.

= My post title is too long for my navigation lists. Is there a way to pick a different label for navigation lists? =

While editing your page, enter an alternate navigation label in the “Label” text field inside the “Placement in Navigation” metabox. If the metabox is not visible, expand the “Screen Options” panel at the upper right hand corner of the screen and make sure the “Placement in Navigation” checkbox is checked.

= Is there a way to prevent my users from adding top level content to the primary navigation menu? =

Visit the “Appearance > Primary Navigation” screen and uncheck the “Allow Top-Level Pages” checkbox. Be sure to click “Save Changes” to save the setting. With this option unchecked, post authors will not be allowed to publish a top level page if the “Display in navigation lists” checkbox is checked.

= I’m a theme / plugin developer that would like to take advantage of the navigation library, but I don’t want any of the administrative interface enhancements. Is there a way to disable them? =
Yes! The navigation manager interface, content navigation widget, and other plugin features can be disabled on a per-install or theme-by-theme basis.
